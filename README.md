# Data Science Specializations Repository
This repository combines the files from different Data Science courses and specializations I've taken so far and will be frequently updated.

NOTE: Although you are more than welcome to use the code posted here as guide, **I do encourage you to try your own solutions before using it**... At the end of the day, making your own mistakes is the best way to learn.

### [Udemy - Python for Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)
A comprehensive course to learning how to use the power of Python to analyze data, create beautiful visualizations, and use powerful machine learning algorithms.

### [University of Michigan - Applied Data Science with Python Specialization (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)
I found this specialization a good starting point if you want to learn how to code for data analysis in Python, however, in my opinion, it lacks a bit of theory in order to get a better understanding about *the reasons to use one method or another*.

#### List of course repositories
1. [Introduction to Data Science in Python](/U_Michigan_Applied_Data_Science_with_Python_-_Coursera/Course_1_Introduction_to_Data_Science_Python)
2. *[Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python (Pending)]*
3. *[Applied Machine Learning in Python (Pending)]*
4. *[Applied Text Mining in Python (Pending)]*
5. *[Applied Social Network Analysis in Python (Pending)]*

### [University of California, San Diego - Data Science MicroMasters (edX)](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/data-science)
This specialization will give you a good theory foundations to analyze data science projects, however I would suggest to take the UMichigan specialization first to have better programming skills before getting into deep with this specialization.

#### List of course repositories
1. [Python for Data Science](UC_San_Diego_Data_Science_Micromaster_-_edX/Course_01_Python_for_Data_Science)
