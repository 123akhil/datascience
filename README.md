# Data Science Specializations Repository
This repository combines the files from different Data Science courses and specializations I've taken so far and will be frequently updated.

NOTE: Although you are more than welcome to use the code posted here as guide, **I do encourage you to try your own solutions before using it**... At the end of the day, making your own mistakes is not only the best way to learn but also what we call experience.

### [NYU - Information Visualization Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/information-visualization)
This specialization provides learners with the necessary knowledge and practical skills to develop a strong foundation in information visualization and to design and develop advanced applications for visual data analysis.

The specialization is meant to prepare students to work on complex data science projects that require the development of interactive visual interfaces for data analysis.

#### List of course repositories
1. [Information Visualization: Foundations](NYU_Information_Visualization/01_Foundations)
2. [Information Visualization: Applied Perception](NYU_Information_Visualization/02_Applied_Perception)
3. [Information Visualization: Programming with D3.js](NYU_Information_Visualization/03_Programming_D3)

### [Udemy - Python for Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)
A comprehensive course to learning how to use the power of Python to analyze data, create beautiful visualizations, and use powerful machine learning algorithms.

### [University of Michigan - Applied Data Science with Python Specialization (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)
I found this specialization a good starting point if you want to learn how to code for data analysis in Python, however, in my opinion, it lacks a bit of theory in order to get a better understanding about *the reasons to use one method or another*.

#### List of course repositories
1. [Introduction to Data Science in Python](U_Michigan_Applied_Data_Science_with_Python_-_Coursera/Course_1_Introduction_to_Data_Science_Python)
2. [Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python](U_Michigan_Applied_Data_Science_with_Python_-_Coursera/Course_2_Applied_Plotting)
3. *[Applied Machine Learning in Python (Pending)]*
4. *[Applied Text Mining in Python (Pending)]*
5. *[Applied Social Network Analysis in Python (Pending)]*

### [University of California, San Diego - Data Science MicroMasters (edX)](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/data-science)
This specialization will give you a good theory foundations to analyze data science projects, however I would suggest to take the UMichigan specialization first to have better programming skills before getting into deep with this specialization.

#### List of course repositories
1. [Python for Data Science](UC_San_Diego_Data_Science_Micromaster_-_edX/Course_01_Python_for_Data_Science)
2. *[Statistics and Probability in Data Science using Python (Pending)]*
3. *[Machine Learning for Data Science (Pending)]*
4. *[Big Data Analytics Using Spark (Pending)]*

### [MITx - 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python (edX)](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python)
An introduction to computer science as a tool to solve real-world analytical problems using Python 3.5.
