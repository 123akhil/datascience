# Data Science Specializations Repository
This repository combines the files from different Data Science courses and specializations I've taken.

NOTE: Despite you can use the code from the different files as guide, **I do encourage you to try your own solutions before using the code posted here**.


### [University of Michigan - Applied Data Science with Python Specialization (Coursera)](*)
##### [(Read more on this specialization)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)

I found this specialization a good starting point if you want to learn how to code for data analysis in Python, however, in my opinion, it lacks a bit of theory in order to get a better understanding about *the reasons to use one method or another*.

##### List of courses repos
1. [Introduction to Data Science in Python]()
2. *[Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python (Pending)]*
3. *[Applied Machine Learning in Python (Pending)]*
4. *[Applied Text Mining in Python (Pending)]*
5. *[Applied Social Network Analysis in Python (Pending)]*


### [University of California, San Diego - Data Science MicroMasters (edX)](*)
##### [(Read more on this specialization)](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/data-science)

This specialization will give you a good theory foundations to analyze data science projects, however I would suggest to take the UMichigan specialization first to have better programming skills before getting into deep with this specialization.
